PantherDen-Backend
==================

API backend for the Panther Den project

Rough planning/functionally:

* User accesses [front-end](https://github.com/ZetaOmicron/PantherDen-Frontend)
* User signs in
* User can see PantherDen roster
* User can see people who are supposed to be in that class
* User can take attendance
* User can search
* User can request other students
* User can see a calender of upcoming scheduling
